# Explainable Writer Verification with Autoencoders and Feature Fusion

Biometrics are a popular method for verifying the identity of individuals based on their unique physical and behavioral traits. This repository presents a novel approach to explainable writer verification using autoencoders as well as a new feature fusion architecture that combines line level and character level features.

This is my main contribution to the final year research project titled Exam Candidate Verification Through Handwritten Artifacts, available [here](https://github.com/hasathcharu/exam-candidate-verification). I was responsible for designing and developing Module 3 â€“ Personalized Writer Verification with Manual Feature Extraction.

## Key Features

- Novel feature fusion architecture that combines line level and character level features.
- Autoencoder-based approach for writer verification.
- SHAP-based explanations to understand the model's predictions.
- LLM-assisted SHAP value interpretations for enhanced understandability of model decisions.
